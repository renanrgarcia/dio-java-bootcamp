# Java Class Anatomy

## Naming patterns

- Class name should be in PascalCase
- Variable names should be in camelCase
- Constant names should be in UPPER_CASE
  - Use `final` for constants to avoid reassignment. Ex: `final int WEEK_DAYS = 7;`

## Variables and methods

- Variable structure: `type name = value;`. Ex: `double height = 1.8;` and `Dog spyke;` (without value assignment)
- Method structure:

```java
  public static returnType methodName (type param1, type param2) {
    // method body
  }
```

- The method name should be an infinitive verb

## Archives and packages

- Use `package` to organize your code
  - There are conventions for naming packages. Ex: `com.companyName.notification` // com -> comercial
  - On VSCode, the packages are like folders. Each dot is a folder level. Ex: `com.companyName.notification` -> `com/companyName/notification/oneClass.java`
- Qualified name: `com.companyName.notification.oneClass`

## Java Beans

- Orientations to variables:
  - Clear and no abreviations
  - Always on singular, except for arrays and collections
  - Only one language, preferable English
- Orientations to methods:
  - Always with verbs on infinitive
  - One action by method
