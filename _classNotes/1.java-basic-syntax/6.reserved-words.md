- Access modifiers
  - `public`: access by all classes
  - `private`: access only by the class itself
  - `protected`: access by the class and its subclasses (inheritance)
- Primitive types
  - `boolean`: true or false
  - `byte`: 8 bits integer (signed)
  - `char`: 16 bits integer (unsigned)
  - `short`: 16 bits integer (signed)
  - `int`: 32 bits integer (signed)
  - `long`: 64 bits integer (signed)
  - `float`: 32 bits floating point
  - `double`: 64 bits floating point (signed)
  - `void`: no return
- Class, method, variable modifiers
  - `class`: class declaration
  - `abstract`: cannot be instantiated, its methods must be implemented by subclasses
  - `extends`: indicate the superclass that the subclass inherits from
  - `final`: forbid class extension, method overriding or variable reassignment
  - `implements`: indicate the interfaces that the class implements
  - `interface`: interface declaration
  - `native`: native code, for example C or C++
  - `new`: create an object, calling the class constructor
  - `static`: make a method or variable belong to the class, no need to create an object to call it
  - `strictfp`: floating point precision
  - `synchronized`: methods only called by one thread at a time
  - `transient`: prevents the serialization of fields, to save memory
  - `volatile`: variable can be updated during thread uses
- Flux control inside a code block
  - `break`: exit the loop
  - `case`: switch case

  - `default`: default case if no other case is matched
  - `do`: do-while loop
  - `else`: if-else

  - `instanceof`: check if an object belongs to a class
  - `return`: exit the method and return the value, if any
  - `switch`: switch statement
  - `while`: while loop
- Error handling
  - `assert`: check if a condition is true
  - `catch`: declare the catch block to handle exceptions
  - `throw`: throw an exception to the caller of the method
  - `throws`: declare the exceptions that can be thrown
  - `try`: code block that will try to execute
  - `finally`: code block that will always execute after the try-catch block
- Reference variables
  - `this`: reference to the current object
  - `super`: reference to the immediate superclass
- Not used words
  - `const`: use instead -> `public static final`
  - `goto`: not implemented on Java

### Literals reserved

- They are `null`, `true`, `false`

### Opposite words
