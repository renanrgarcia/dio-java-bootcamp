# Java Class Anatomy
## Naming patterns
- Class name should be in PascalCase
- Variable names should be in camelCase
- Constant names should be in UPPER_CASE
  - Use `final` for constants to avoid reassignment. Ex: `final int WEEK_DAYS = 7;`

## Variables and methods
- Variable structure: `type name = value;`. Ex: `double height = 1.8;` and `Dog spyke;` (without value assignment)
- Method structure: 
```java
  public static returnType methodName (type param1, type param2) {
    // method body
  }
```
  - The method name should be an infinitive verb
