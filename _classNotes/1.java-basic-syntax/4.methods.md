# Methods
- Actions that can be performed on objects, or classes' functions
- Must be named with verbs, can have parameters
- Pattern camelCase
- Examples:
  - `sum(int n1, int n2){}`
  - `openConnection(){}`
  - `findById(int id){}`
  - `calculatePrint(){}` // something is wrong with this method, have more than one responsibility
- In Java doesn't exist global methods, so you need to create them inside a class
- Method creation criteria: 
  - What is the purpose of the method? // Single responsibility
  - What is its return type? // If there is a return, if not, return void. But can have parameters
  - What is its parameters?
  - Is there a risk of exceptions? // Sometimes we need to handle exceptions
    - Ex: `public double divide(int n1, int n2) throws Exception{}`
  - What is the visibility of the method? // 1. All aplications, 2. Public, 3. Private, 4. Protected
