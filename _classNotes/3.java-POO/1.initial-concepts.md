# Initial Concepts

## Classes Types

- `Model`: represents the domain structure of the application.
- `Service`: contains the bussiness rules and validations.
- `Repository`: contains the database integration.
- `Controller`: responsible for external communication, such as HTTP requests or WebServices.
- `Util`: contains the common utilities for the application.

- MVC model, used on Desktop, Web, Mobile and REST HTTP.

### Concessionaire Example

- Models: `Car`, `Client`, `FiscalDocument`, `Sale`
- Services: `CarService`, `ClientService`, `ConcessionaireService`, `WorkshopService`
- Repositories: `CarRepository`, `ClientRepository`
- Utils: `FormatUtils`, `DateUtils`

## Package Structure

- `src`: source files, contains the source code of the application.
- Format: `[top-level domain].[company/organization name].[project/application name].[module/feature]`

  - Example breakdown - Let's use `com.techmart.ecommerce.services.ProductService` (Package address + class name) from our previous example:
    `com` is the top-level domain
    `techmart` is the company name
    `ecommerce` is the project or application name
    `services` is the module or feature
    `ProductService` is the class name

- Common top-level domains:
  `com`: Commercial organizations
  `org`: Non-profit organizations
  `edu`: Educational institutions
  `gov`: Government entities

- Common modules/features:
  `model`: Represents the model/layer of the application (Client, Order, Product, etc)
  `service`: Contains the bussiness rules and validations (OrderService, ProductService, etc)
  `repository`: Contains the database integration classes/interfaces (CarRepository, ClientRepository, etc)
  `controller`: Responsible for external communication, such as HTTP requests or WebServices (CarController, ClientController, etc)
  `view`: Handles the presentation of data (CarView, ClientView, etc)
  `util`: Contains the common utilities for the application (DateUtils, FormatUtils, etc)

## Package declaration and imports

- Use `import` to import classes from other packages
- Use `package` to name classes and packages
- Example:

  ```java
  package com.techmart.ecommerce.services; // package address definition

  // import classes
  import com.techmart.ecommerce.models.Product;
  import com.techmart.ecommerce.repository.ProductRepository;
  import com.techmart.ecommerce.service.ProductService;

  public class ProductService {
    // class definition
  }
  ```
