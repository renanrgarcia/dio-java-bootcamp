# OOP pillars

- `Encapsulation`: not everything needs to be visible. Example: start a vehicle needs various steps, but the driver only sees the ignition and the "magic" happens
- `Inheritance`: common features and behaviors can be elevated and shared between an object hierarchy. Example: car and motorcycle share properties like wheels and engines and methods like accelerate and brake, so we can have a vehicle class inherited by motorcycle and car
- `Abstraction`: unavailability to determine the logic behind the behavior of an object. Example: the accelerate and break actions must be abstracts, because there are different ways to do those actions
- `Polymorphism`: inumerous ways to do the same action. Example: the brake action can be done in different ways depending on the type of vehicle

## Protected modifiers

- `protected`: can be accessed from class and its subclasses

## Abstract class

- Example:

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
  public abstract void accelerate();
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  public void accelerate() {
    // accelerate
  }
}
```

## Interface

- `interface`: class that only contains abstract methods and properties. More advanced than abstract class
- Differences between abstract class and interface:
  - On interfaces, the subclasses can have different papers on the application
- Java does not support multiple inheritance. But with interfaces we can
- Example of multiple inheritance with interfaces:

```java
interface Vehicle {
  void accelerate();
}

interface Engine {
  void start();
}

class Car implements Vehicle, Engine {
  @Override
  public void accelerate() {
    // accelerate
  }

  @Override
  public void start() {
    // start
  }
}
```
