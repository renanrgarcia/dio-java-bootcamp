# OOP pillars

- `Encapsulation`: not everything needs to be visible. Example: start a vehicle needs various steps, but the driver only sees the ignition and the "magic" happens
- `Inheritance`: common features and behaviors can be elevated and shared between an object hierarchy. Example: car and motorcycle share properties like wheels and engines and methods like accelerate and brake, so we can have a vehicle class inherited by motorcycle and car
- `Abstraction`: unavailability to determine the logic behind the behavior of an object. Example: the accelerate and break actions must be abstracts, because there are different ways to do those actions
- `Polymorphism`: inumerous ways to do the same action. Example: the brake action can be done in different ways depending on the type of vehicle
