# Constructors

- It is a special method that is called when an object is created
- It has the same name as the class
- Example:

```java
public MyClass(String name, String lastName) {
  this.name = name;
  this.lastName = lastName;
}
```

- Use only the necessary attributes to create an object, the optional ones can be added later. For example on the setter method.
