# Exception Structures

## try-catch-finally

```java
try {
  // code
} catch (Exception e) {
  // code
} finally { // optional
  // code
}
```

### More common exceptions

- `java.lang.NullPointerException`: when retrieving from `null` reference
- `java.lang.ArithmeticException`: when dividing by zero
- `java.sql.SQLException`: when accessing database
- `java.io.FileNotFoundException`: when reading or writing to a not existing file

## Exception hierarchy

- 1. Error: the program can't continue
- 2. Exception: the program can continue, but are two types:
  - 2.1. `Checked Exceptions`:
    Must be explicitly caught or declared in the method signature
    Extend Exception class (excluding RuntimeException)
    Compiler enforces handling
    Example: IOException, SQLException
  - 2.2. `Unchecked Exceptions (RuntimeException)`:
    Don't need to be explicitly caught or declared
    Extend RuntimeException
    Compiler doesn't enforce handling
    Example: NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException

## Custom exceptions

```java
class MyException extends Exception {
  // code
}
```

- Use:
  - `throw new MyException();`

## Debugging

- Syntax errors: when the code doesn't compile
- Semantic (logic) errors: when the code doesn't work as expected

## Other concepts

- Execution pile: the stack of methods that are executing
- Stack trace: is the matrix of calls that led to the error
